[![Framer connects Xquik MCP to coding agents](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4UOSpoOoC3Y/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4UOSpoOoC3Y?t=367)

[Watch how Framer uses Xquik scrapers](https://youtu.be/4UOSpoOoC3Y?t=367) with
Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and more, from 6:07.

Xquik is the world's fastest & cheapest X (Twitter) scraper service with the
most complete X data. Xquik's X (Twitter) News Monitor sorts news posts by
format, source attribution & relevance. Most other Apify Actors charge before
filtering or deduplicating. Xquik charges only for delivered, unique,
filter-matching results. AI costs are included in the per-tweet price. You need
no AI account, tokens or key.

Sort news posts on X (Twitter) by type & keep the original tweet data. Xquik's
**X (Twitter) News Monitor with AI Analysis** collects posts about your topics.
It adds an AI-powered format, source attribution & relevance answer to every
post. Separate reporting from commentary & speculation. See whether a post names
or links a source. Keep only posts about the organizations, people or topics you
track.

- **Format.** It tells reporting, commentary, speculation, promotion & satire
  apart.
- **Attribution.** It shows whether a claim names a source, links one, is
  firsthand or has none.
- **Relevance.** It tells posts about your targets apart from namesakes.
- **Complete source records.** Every row keeps every field the tweet exposes,
  including linked articles when available.

## How to classify news posts on X

1. Add search terms such as `Nvidia earnings lang:en -filter:retweets`, news
   account handles or tweet IDs.
2. Set `maxItems` & extraction filters such as date bounds, `filter:links` or
   minimum reposts.
3. Put the organizations, people or topics you track under `analysis.targets`,
   with aliases. Narrow the topic in `analysis.context`.
4. Start the run & open the dataset.

```json
{
  "searchTerms": ["Nvidia earnings lang:en -filter:retweets"],
  "maxItems": 300,
  "analysis": {
    "targets": [{ "name": "Nvidia", "aliases": ["NVDA", "Jensen Huang"] }],
    "context": "Financial & product news about the chip maker."
  }
}
```

### What the Actor answers

- Format: Reporting, commentary, speculation, promotion, satire, unrelated or
  unclear
- Attribution: Named, linked, firsthand, absent or unclear
- Relevance: Probability that the reported event concerns your targets

Classification does not verify facts. Naming a source does not make it credible.
Attribution describes what the post presents.

## Analyze your own text

Paste your own drafts, replies, reviews or notes in `texts`. Xquik's X (Twitter)
News Monitor analyzes them. It fetches nothing from X.

```json
{
  "texts": [
    "Central bank holds rates at 4.5%, signals 2 cuts next year.",
    "I was at the port this morning. Cranes are idle & trucks are queued."
  ]
}
```

- Each text becomes 1 row with the same `analysis` answers as a tweet.
- `tweet.id` is `text:1`, `text:2` & so on, & `tweet.type` is `text`.
- Each analyzed text costs the same $0.0003 as an analyzed tweet.
- With `texts` set, the run analyzes only those texts. Run X targets separately.

## How much does it cost to classify news posts on X?

Xquik's X (Twitter) News Monitor costs from $0.0003 per analyzed tweet. It
charges no start fee. The price includes collection & AI costs. You need no AI
account, tokens or key. The price covers up to 8 questions & 64,000 bytes of
context per tweet. Each question definition may use up to 8,000 bytes.

Extraction filters & deduplication run before analysis. You never pay for
filtered-out or duplicate rows. Failed analyses, skipped analyses & diagnostic
rows have no result charge. Apify bills platform usage for compute, storage &
transfer separately at your plan's rates. The Pricing tab shows it.

## Input & output examples

The input above is copy-ready. An abbreviated output row looks like this:

```json
{
  "tweet": { "id": "2100673144985993441", "text": "…", "retweetCount": 40 },
  "analysis": {
    "status": "succeeded",
    "answers": [
      {
        "questionId": "format",
        "type": "choice",
        "value": "reporting",
        "confidence": 0.9
      },
      {
        "questionId": "attribution",
        "type": "choice",
        "value": "named",
        "confidence": 0.84
      },
      { "questionId": "relevance", "type": "probability", "probability": 0.98 }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each result contains `tweet` & `analysis`. Answers include types, question
versions & available probabilities. A row with a failed or skipped analysis
keeps the collected tweet & a `reason`. Its answer list is empty.

When a post links an X Article, the analysis also fetches that article. It adds
the title, preview & text blocks as context.
`analysis.contextAvailability.article` reports `text_blocks`, `summary` or
`not_supplied`. `summary` means the title & preview only.

Free diagnostics in the key-value store explain invalid inputs, missing results
& interrupted collection. The run report separates collected rows, charged
analyses & pending charges.

## Run summary & flat answers

A run writes an `analysis-summary` record to its key-value store in 4 cases:

- It hits a problem or is large.
- It sets `monitor` without `baselineDatasetId`, as the first run of a series.
- Its comparison finds a changed, new or not comparable tweet.
- It has `alwaysSaveRunRecords` on.

Other runs skip the record. Their status names the top answer, like
`Top format: reporting in 4 of 5 results.` A comparison without a change states
`No change since the earlier run.` A run that hits a problem or is large also
writes `run-report`. So does a run with `alwaysSaveRunRecords` on. `run-report`
repeats the summary under `results.analysisSummary`.

The summary counts analyzed, failed & skipped rows. It sums engagement &
summarizes every question.

- The `format` split separates reporting from commentary, speculation, promotion
  & satire.
- `attribution` counts named, linked, firsthand & absent sources.
- `relevance` counts posts about each target.
- `targets` gives mentions per target. Each target's `top` lists its most
  engaged posts per answer category.
- Each `targets` entry has `choices`, the format & attribution split for posts
  about that target.
- `sourceDomains` counts linked domains across the run.
- `monitor.changedRows` lists posts whose decisions moved since the baseline.
- Every row lists `sourceDomains`, the hostnames it links to.
- Every row lists `cashtags` found in its text, such as `$NVDA`.
- With `monitor.baselineDatasetId` set, the summary's `monitor` block counts
  comparison statuses. It lists up to 50 changed rows.

Every result row also carries `answers`, a flat map keyed by question ID. Each
value is the chosen category, score or probability. The `Flat answers` dataset
view & CSV or Excel exports show 1 column per question. The columns sit beside
the tweet, so spreadsheets need no JSON parsing. Failed & skipped rows carry an
empty map.

## Compare with an earlier run

Pass `monitor.baselineDatasetId`, the dataset ID of a completed earlier run with
the same analysis settings. The comparison reads that run's rows. It works even
when that run skipped its summary. Every row then gains a `monitor` object. Its
status can be:

- `first_run` without a baseline.
- `new_to_baseline` for tweets the earlier run did not have.
- `unchanged` or `changed` for tweets it had.

`changes` lists each format, attribution or relevance decision that moved from
`previous` to `current`. Decisions compare by category, rounded score level or
yes/no at 0.5. A decision counts as changed only when it moves clearly. Near
ties between runs stay `unchanged`.

A baseline above `maxBaselineRows`, or from different settings, stops the run
before collection. The run then writes a diagnostic row. `maxBaselineRows`
defaults to 100,000.

## FAQ & support

Answers to common questions, then where to get help.

### Do I need an AI account, X API key or login?

No. Xquik's X (Twitter) News Monitor includes AI costs in its price. You need no
AI account, tokens or key. You also need no X API key, login or credentials.

### Can I use my own questions?

Yes. Custom `analysis.questions` replace the defaults. Send 1 to 8 `choice`,
`score` or `probability` questions. Choice questions accept 2 to 255 categories.
Score questions need at least 2 ordered levels. Keep the same questions across
runs you want to compare.

### Why did a row come back with a failed or skipped analysis?

`analysis.status` is `failed` or `skipped`. The Actor collected & delivered the
tweet, but the AI analysis did not complete. `analysis.reason` names the cause.
`context_limit` means your context & targets leave no room for the tweet.
`service_unavailable` means the analysis service was briefly unavailable. These
rows carry no result charge. Shorten `analysis.context` or rerun the affected
IDs.

The Actor still analyzes a tweet longer than `maxContextBytes`. It cuts quoted &
replied-to posts first, then the tweet. `analysis.contextAvailability.postText`
is then `truncated`. Raise `maxContextBytes` up to 64,000 to keep more text.

### Does the analysis verify facts?

No. Answers describe what the post expresses & how the post frames it.
Probabilities express AI confidence, not truth. Review important classifications
against the original tweet, which every row keeps.

### Which languages work?

Extraction supports every language X serves. We validate analysis on English
customer scenarios first. Other supported languages return answers with the same
structure. `unclear` categories & probabilities show uncertainty in every
language.

### How do I limit cost?

Filters, deduplication & `maxItems` run before analysis. You pay only for
unique, filter-matching tweets. Use precise search operators, date bounds &
engagement floors. Start with a small `maxItems` to check answer quality before
a large run.

### Is it legal to analyze X data?

The Actor requests public X fields. Results can contain personal data. Confirm a
lawful purpose & follow applicable privacy rules. Ask qualified counsel when
uncertain.

### Can I use the API, schedules & integrations?

Yes. See the [API tab](https://apify.com/xquik/x-twitter-news-monitor/api) for
Python, JavaScript & cURL examples. Use Apify
[schedules](https://docs.apify.com/platform/schedules) for recurring runs. Pass
the previous dataset ID as `monitor.baselineDatasetId` to see what changed.
Apify integrations also connect runs to webhooks, Make, Zapier, n8n & Google
Sheets.

### Where do I get help?

Open an issue on the Actor page or contact <support@xquik.com> with the run ID.
Free diagnostics in the key-value store explain empty, partial or interrupted
runs.
