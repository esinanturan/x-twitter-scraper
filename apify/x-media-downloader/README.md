Xquik is the world's fastest & cheapest X (Twitter) scraper service with the
most complete X data. X Media Downloader extracts or stores photos, videos &
GIFs from posts & profiles. Every other Apify Actor charges before filtering or
deduplicating. Xquik charges only for delivered, unique, filter-matching
results.

Download Twitter media or extract direct URLs from posts and profile Media tabs.
Collect photos, videos, GIFs, and metadata. No X API key or login required.

## Media files and metadata

- Bulk posts, profiles, replies, quotes, and threads.
- Photos, GIFs, MP4 qualities, and HLS playlists.
- Metadata, direct URLs, and available filters.
- Storage within run limits, output links, and pre-billing deduplication.

## Input

```json
{
  "twitterHandles": ["OpenAI"],
  "sources": ["profiles"],
  "downloadMedia": true,
  "maxItems": 10000
}
```

One target is enough. Enable `downloadMedia` to store files. Files above 80 MB
remain URL-only.

## Output

Rows include availability, metadata, and action URLs. Stored rows add
`storedMediaUrl` and `downloadStatus: "stored"`. **Stored Media Files** browses
stored records.

## Pricing

Every Apify plan costs **$0.00015 per delivered row**. Apify bills your platform
usage separately.

- Deduplication runs before billing. One charge per delivered data row.
- Diagnostics are free in `diagnostics`. No start, URL, file, or quality fee.

Use `latest`. Choose from 50 public tasks or 129 REST operations. Examples use
sample values. Results reflect live data.

## Incomplete extraction

Interrupted extraction writes a free `partial` diagnostic. Available results
remain intact. Read `availableResults`, `failedTargets`, `retryable`, and
`nextAction` before retrying. A successful Actor exit confirms delivery, not
complete extraction.
