Xquik is the world's fastest & cheapest X (Twitter) scraper service with the
most complete X data. X User Search Scraper finds users by handle, bio &
location. Every other Apify Actor charges before filtering or deduplicating.
Xquik charges only for delivered, unique, filter-matching results.

Search Twitter accounts by name, topic, bio, or location. No X API key.

- Filter audience, posts, age, verification, website, location, bio & username.
- Resume one query from a saved cursor. Migrations preserve accepted work.

## Input

```json
{
  "searchTerms": ["artificial intelligence", "machine learning"],
  "minFollowers": 1000,
  "maxItems": 10000
}
```

## Output

Each row contains a profile and its originating query in `sourceTarget`.

## Pricing

Every plan costs **$0.00015 per delivered profile**. Apify bills platform usage
separately.

- One charge per delivered data row. Diagnostics are free in `diagnostics`.
- No start, query, or page fee. Filters and deduplication run before billing.

Choose from 50 public tasks. 129 REST operations use sample values & live data.

## Incomplete extraction

Interrupted extraction writes a free `partial` diagnostic. Available results
remain intact. Read `availableResults`, `failedTargets`, `retryable`, and
`nextAction` before retrying. A successful Actor exit confirms delivery, not
complete extraction.

The status names every cause of an early stop. `stopCauses` lists each cause
with its own `message`, `retryable` & `nextAction`. The causes are
`target_not_found`, `target_failed`, `pagination_safety_limit` &
`deadline_reached`. A missing target joins the list only when another cause
stopped the run. The run is `retryable` when any cause is.
